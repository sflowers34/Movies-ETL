# Movies-ETL

## Overview

Amazing Prime has requested an automated pipeline that will take in new data, transform the data, and then load the data into existing tables. 
This project will explore the data pipeline process also known as Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL). The ETL moves information between databases and transforms the data into consistent reliable data, as well as create data storage for the data.

The following tasks will be carried out in this project :

•	Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files, which can be viewed in the ETL_function_test.IPYNB file.

•	Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data, which can be viewed in the ETL_clean_wiki_movies.IPYNB file.

•	Extract and Transform the Kaggle data, which can be viewed in the ETL_clean_kaggle_data.IPYNB file. 

•	Create the Movie Database, which can be viewed in the ETL_create_database.IPYNB file.
